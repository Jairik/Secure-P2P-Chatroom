## 🔐 Symmetric Encryption Algorithms: AES and ChaCha20-Poly1305

Modern secure messaging relies on robust symmetric ciphers like the **Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)** and **ChaCha20** for fast, confidential data encryption.

- **AES** remains a trusted workhorse with strong security margins.
- **ChaCha20-Poly1305** is a modern favorite for high-performance encryption, especially on devices without AES hardware acceleration.
